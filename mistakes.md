## Learn from the mistakes of others

A place to share mistakes and horror stories about interviewing **from which someone might benefit**. *Not* a place to gripe, however! Did you do something (or forget to do something) before or during your interview that could have been avoided? Share it here! Feel free to go into as much detail as you want, but please keep all parties anonymous and avoid griping or complaining.

1. **Practice**. You're already here, so that's a good sign, I guess...
1. **Learn to sell yourself and your achievements**. For some, this comes naturally, but for others it may not.  
1. **Don't miss your appointment**. This should be obvious, but sh1t happens. Set alarms and duplicate calendar events and reminders. Just do it.
