      <description>About This is an open-source (please contribute!) repository for interview questions, tips, and resources for early career ecologists and biologists. Any and all are encouraged to submit questions, resources, or tips (see How to Make Contributions section below).
I have yet to come across an open resource out there (kind of like the EcoEvo jobs or EcoEvo postdoc opportunities sheets). If other editable/open source question-sharing resources exist, please add here or email me 1Most of the resources I have come across are static, and not open to additions/edits beyond the comments section.</description>

      <description>Learn from the mistakes of others A place to share mistakes and horror stories about interviewing from which someone might benefit. Not a place to gripe, however! Did you do something (or forget to do something) before or during your interview that could have been avoided? Share it here! Feel free to go into as much detail as you want, but please keep all parties anonymous and avoid griping or complaining.</description>

      <description>Interview Questions for the Early-career Ecologist Your [Research] Interests &amp;amp; Goals  If you had (e.g.) $1M to spend, how would you do allocate it (you cannot pay yourself!)? What skills will you bring to this position/lab/institute? Why are you a good fit? How can this position/lab/institute help you achieve your goals? Why do you want this position? Have you written grants? What funding sources do you intend to seek whilst here?</description>
