## Intent

Are you looking for a job? [Me too](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/cv/blob/master/extendedCV/burnett_extendedResume.pdf)! I assumed there was an open resource out there similar to the [EcoEvo jobs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z64-PTCydZIB_afaYXYUf4fVniFckHmGZwVgbeg4nNY/edit#gid=1915727790) and [postdoc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHkWrbvNrRdhJL9Z8ucgBZ2HSts2GPA_yozbQPl_x_8/edit#gid=0) Google sheets , but couldn't find anything. **If other editable/open source question-sharing resources exist, please add here or email me <sup>[*](#mailto)</sup>**

This is an **open-source**  repository for interview questions, tips, and resources for early career ecologists and biologists. Most of the resources I have come across are static, and not open to additions/edits beyond the comments section.  It is my goal to maintain this repository as a fluid resource for those seeking interview prep help and for those recently interviewed to questions they were asked. 




## Other Resources
### Interview blogposts and webpages (static):
1. [WildlifeSNPits (Stephanie Schuttler, 2014)](https://wildlifesnpits.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/what-to-expect-when-interviewing-for-ecology-and-conservation-jobs/). A static blog post containing a list of questions and a brief section on tips for interviewing in person and Skype.  
1. [jobinterviewquestions.com](https://www.jobinterviewquestions.com/biologist-plant-animal). A generic questions database. It may be a database of the same questions with the word "biologist" inserted where applicable.
