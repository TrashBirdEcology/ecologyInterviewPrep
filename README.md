This is an open-source and active repository for sharing interview questions, tips, and resources for early career ecologists and biologists. It is my goal to maintain this repository as a fluid resource for those seeking interview prep help and for those recently interviewed to share their questions. Anonymous 

Most of the resources I have come across are static, and not open to additions/edits beyond the comments section.  If there are other editable/open source question-sharing resources out there, please suggest an edit to this RMD or email me (*jessicaleighburnett at gmail dot com*)
