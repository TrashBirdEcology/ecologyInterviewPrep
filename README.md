## About
This is an **open-source**  repository for interview questions, tips, and resources for early career ecologists and biologists. Any and all are encouraged to submit questions, resources, or tips (see `How to Make Contributions` section below).

I have yet to come across an open resource out there (kind of like the [EcoEvo jobs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z64-PTCydZIB_afaYXYUf4fVniFckHmGZwVgbeg4nNY/edit#gid=1915727790) or [EcoEvo postdoc opportunities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHkWrbvNrRdhJL9Z8ucgBZ2HSts2GPA_yozbQPl_x_8/edit#gid=0) sheets). If other editable/open source question-sharing resources exist, please add here or email me <sup>[1](#mailto)</sup>

Most of the resources I have come across are static, and not open to additions/edits beyond the comments section.  It is my goal to maintain this repository as a fluid resource for those seeking interview prep help and for those recently interviewed to questions they were asked.

## Other Resources
### Interview blogposts and webpages (static):
1. [WildlifeSNPits (Stephanie Schuttler, 2014)](https://wildlifesnpits.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/what-to-expect-when-interviewing-for-ecology-and-conservation-jobs/). A static blog post containing a list of questions and a brief section on tips for interviewing in person and Skype.  
1. [jobinterviewquestions.com](https://www.jobinterviewquestions.com/biologist-plant-animal). A generic questions database. It may be a database of the same questions with the word "biologist" inserted where applicable. 
1. [Dynamic Ecology (Meghan Duffy, 2013)](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/tag/job-interviews/). Friday links, mostly for getting academic jobs. 
1. [Marissa Baskett (last updated?)](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/links/academia.html#Advice). **Tons** of links for various aspects of the job search process for academics. Some links are 404, so not sure if this is still maintained.

### Job boards 
1. [Wildlife & Fisheries, all levels (hosted by TAMU)](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/jobs/) 
1. [Quantitative postdocs/fellowships (editable with permission)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHkWrbvNrRdhJL9Z8ucgBZ2HSts2GPA_yozbQPl_x_8/edit#gid=0)

1. [ResearchGate](researchgate.net/jobs). if your profile is UTD the suggestions are limited but decent 
1. [USAJobs](usajobs.gov). U.S. Government jobs. For Ecology/Biology jobs, search code `0408`
1. [ORISE](https://www.zintellect.com/).  Several Federal agencies use ORISE for student through Post-doc opportunities.  Try keyword search on "ecology" for recent positions.  They can be slow to remove the positions so be sure to sort by "Posted"
1. [EPA Office of Research and Development Post-Doctoral Positions](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ordpd/PostDoc_SearchResults.cfm).  Term federal post-doc positions in a variety of environmental fields.  GS-11 to GS-12 pay rates, full fed benefits.
